# 🗓️ Daily Tasks & Priorities - hamdiwork Edition

Yo! Welcome to my little brainchild 😎  
This is a **fun, chill, and super handy daily task manager** I built with Python 🐍 and Tkinter.  

## What it does 💥
- Add / edit / delete your daily tasks (cause who remembers everything? 😅)  
- Keep track of priorities: High / Medium / Low (no slacking! 💪)  
- Set start & end times for tasks ⏰  
- Optional task repeats: Daily / Weekly (repeat, repeat, repeat!) 🔁  
- Save everything automatically to Excel (`tasks.xlsx`) 📊  
- Export your tasks to CSV, cause why not? 💾  
- Desktop notifications for your tasks so you don’t miss them 🔔  

## Requirements 🛠️
- Python 3.8+  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `plyer`  

Install them via:  
```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl plyer
